# Data
The purpose of the data folder is to contain any configuration data that is required for the project to operate. 

It is not recommended that you store test data in your source control repository (primarily because it will cause your repository size to grow rapidly) - the data should be stored seperately, probably in a database, but if you don't have access to a database you could store it in here so that everyone has access to it easily and it is organised. (You may wish to consider making a seperate "data" repository which is contained in a very lightweight MATLAB Project which is then "Referenced" into this Project to import it. This might be the better way of seperating and organising your data.
